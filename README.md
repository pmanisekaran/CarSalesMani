# Code  Challenge

## Requirement

You are required to build a **Production ready** application where you can automatically assign a Salesperson to a customer, based on a set of rules.

We would like to see your Backend and Frontend skills. Don't stress about storing data in database - instead, use the attached JSON file as your data source. Use design patterns and utilise coding best practices whereever applicable.

If you are an experienced Java developer who likes to work on .NET, feel free to use Java in order to build the backend. 

**We are using .NET Core and Angular in our team. And we love clean code.**

## Scenario

All salespeople are assigned to one or more groups from the below list.

- Group A – Speak Greek
- Group B – Sports car specialist
- Group C – Family car specialist
- Group D – Tradie vehicle specialist

**Salespeople Information** 

*you can find this data in [salesperson.json](salesperson.json)*

1. Cierra Vega. (assigned to Group A)
2. Alden Cantrell. (assigned to Group B & Group D)
3. Kierra Gentry. (assigned to Group A & Group C)
4. ...

**Salesperson Assigning Rules**

Rules on assigning a specific salesperson to a customer are below, in order of priority.

If a salesperson is assigned to a customer, that person cannot be assigned to another customer at the same time. If there are no salespeople available, the application should return a message saying, &quot;All salespeople are busy. Please wait.&quot;

| **Customer** | **Looking for** | **Rules** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Speaks Greek** | Sports Car | - Assign someone who speaks greek and good with Sports car. <br/> - If cannot be found, assign someone who is good in Sports car. <br/> - If cannot be found, assign anyone randomly |
| **Speaks Greek** | Family Car | - Assign someone who speaks greek and good with Family car. <br/> - If cannot be found, assign someone who is good in Family car. <br/> - If cannot be found, assign anyone randomly |
| **Regardless of the language** | Tradie Vehicle | - Assign someone who is good with Tradie vehicles <br/> - If cannot be found, assign randomly. |
| **Doesn't speak Greek** | Sports Car | - Assign someone who is good in Sports car. <br/> - If cannot be found, assign anyone randomly. |
| **Doesn't speak Greek** | Family Car | - Assign someone who is good in Family car. <br/> - If cannot be found, assign anyone randomly. |
| **Speaks Greek** | Not looking for anything specific | - Assign someone who speaks greek. <br/> - If cannot be found, assign anyone randomly. |
| **Doesn't speak Greek** | Not looking for anything specific | - Assign anyone randomly. |
